### Litmus
Litmus test your application without learning curves

#### Motivation
>Testing as they say "can show presence of bugs, and not their absence". 

However, we can try to eliminate bugs if we are able to let the stakeholders participate in probing for evidences of bugs. Each stakeholder, be it the developer or the analyst or the product manager or the end user or the tester & so on bring their own set of scenarios that can have a snowball effect in finding bugs that might be hidden deep underneath.

#### Beliefs
- Testing similar to its code, improves with the community participation. 
- Litmus keeps end user in mind while designing its test scenarios.

#### Build
- Run below command to compile the code
 - `make`

#### Appendix
- Scenario: An example of the system's behavior from one or more user's perspectives.
